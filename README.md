## Repository for field-level soybean yield prediction
#### -This repository is for my semester project in CSCI 5961 at St. Louis University.
#### -I am using UAV collected imagery of soybean fields to predict yield.
#### -I use both traditional machine learning algorithms as well as 2D and 3D deep learning algoirthms for yield prediction.
#### -I also test how early in the growing season imagery can be used for accurate yield prediction.
#### -Traditional machine learning methods as found under the 1D_models repository.
#### -DenseNet and ResNet are found under the 2D_models repository.
#### -3D DenseNet and Resnet are found under the 3D_models repository.
#### -Models trained on specific growing season months are found under the temporal_comparison reposistory.
#### - To run a model, navigate to the model repository of your choosing.  Download the appropriate file, upload to your development enviornment and execute the file.
